## Getting Started

1) clone the repository to your desktop

2) create a seperate branch and only work in that (Do not commit to main without approval)

3) run the development server:

click terminal tab on top of vs code

then type...

```bash
npm install 
# this installs the missing node_modules directory (node_modules is too large for github o handle)
# **IMPORTANT node_module will not push to github so delete it before pushing or commiting anything**
# then
npm run dev
#this runs the site on a browser
```
4) Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
